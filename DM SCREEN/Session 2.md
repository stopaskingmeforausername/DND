The trials

The giant marina warfare is seen to be a massive simulation on how warriors will react to civilian deaths, as well as a test of merit to those who deserve to be in battle. the skeleton siblings merge together into a giant blinking eyeball as the proctor of their exams, they are congratulated, and are told that their gifts will be given to them on the mainland, and if they could please row themselves back too land. The eyeball floats off as the marina shows itself to be quite empty, ships appearing in the horizon

As they boat closer they realize they are gaining absolutely no milage, themselves seeming to move in place no matter how hard they push, as they begin to tire out, the same great beast rises up from the water. speaking too the Travelers

"Gain kinship or the talisman of three trusted voices, only then may you gain true entrance too beyond the gates". 

The whales mouth would gate open, a tounge the size of a highway underpass would spew out, a great iron door sitting on the tip of the mountain. Inside is where the task is set



# The Moon puzzle
As you enter this chamber, you are bathed in an almost blinding glow of moonlight beaming in from somewhere above. The floor and walls of this circular chamber are white marble streaked with iridescent gray and lavender. An elaborate lighting fixture hangs from the ceiling, which upon second glance you realize is a group of ornate mirrors suspended and angled to reflect the moonlight and diffuse it throughout the room. Some of the mirrors also create a single shaft of focused moonlight, which forms a large circle on the wall opposite the door. There is a circular pool of water in the middle of the room, its surface still and clear as glass. Two 3 ft. long levers jut out of it. The first lever has a white handle, the second lever has a black handle. As the last member of your party enters the room, the door swings shut of its own accord and the wall begins to rotate around you with a steady whirring and clicking.
## Mechanics
**Two levers in the Moon Pool:**
*White lever*: Two positions (lock/unlock), only works if pool is bathed in concentrated moonlight.
*Black lever:* Six positions, each tied to a gem. Controls vertical position and door alignment.
*Housing unit* six colored gems indicating positions (from rear to front): 
Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple.
**Movement inside the chamber rotates the wall/door.**
*Room functions like an elevator:* black lever sets floor, white lever locks position.
Matching gem on doorframe glows when aligned.
*Door only becomes functional if moonlight beam is directed into the pool.*
*Mirrors must be moved* (DC 15 Athletics or GM method) to focus beam.
Without moonlight, door opens to void → creatures reappear in pool with 1d6+1 psychic damage.
*If alignment is correct and moonlight is active,* pulling the white lever locks the door to allow safe exit.

### Red door:
### Orange door:
**Chamber A**  
The sounds of a factory in full force ring out in your ears, nearly deafening, and you see piles of mechanical arms, legs and torsos dropping out of a chute in the ceiling above, moving away from you on a continuously moving belt powered by small rotors.
_Note 1:_ A series of conveyor belts shift parts into place, moving them 10 ft. every six seconds. A creature walking along the belt adds 10 ft. to its movement speed per turn.

**Chamber B**  
The parts continue moving away from you, but as they pass under a series of rings, they mold and form into humanoid figures. They shift off the tables and then walk between a series of pistons, where they each receive a head, before moving into the next chamber.

_Note 2:_ The assembly ring is a magical field that fuses parts into humanoid forms. A living creature passing through must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be fused with 1d6 of their worn items (1d6 force damage per item). Small creatures can avoid it freely. Medium or larger creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid it.

_Note 3:_ Pistons bolt joints and attach heads. Any creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to navigate. On failure, take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Chamber C**  
H3227
This entire space seems to be overflowing with constructs in what might best be described as sleep mode. Crammed in between unmerciful gears and packed by the exit, it seems their current directive is “be in the way.” Beyond the crowd of constructs you can see a tube that occasionally sucks one up into the ceiling, presumably to start to process all over again.

_Note 4:_ This storage room is full of constructs and machinery, making all movement difficult terrain.

_Note 5:_ A phantom field occasionally removes a construct to be used or scrapped. At GM discretion, it may loop back to Chamber A for a perpetual cycle.

**GM Note: Powerful Props**  
_Unless otherwise noted, the constructs populating this space are non-functional, unless you decide to animate them. If the story you’re telling in this space seems to lend itself to giving these creatures actions, for lower level parties it may be appropriate to swap out a typical construct’s statistics for that of a skeleton (unless of course the party is controlling them in some way, in which case, give them whatever stats you like)._

**Mechanics**
_**Conveyor belts.**_  
Move 10 ft. every 6 seconds. Walking on them grants +10 ft. movement speed per turn.
_**Assembly ring.**_  
Functions like a supercharged _mending_ cantrip. Living creatures must succeed on DC 16 Constitution save or fuse with 1d6 worn items (1d6 force damage per item). Small creatures avoid freely; medium/large must make DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
_**Pistons.**_  
Bolt joints and add heads. DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to navigate. On fail, take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
_**Storage room.**_  
Filled with gears and constructs. Movement is difficult terrain.

**Variant Encounter (Optional)**
**1:** A dilapidated construct in the second chamber expressing its desire to die.  
**2:** A cultist trapped in the third chamber who disguises himself as a construct if he hears the party coming.
**3:** A collection of 4d4 rust monsters who are so full they’re barely able to move.
**4:** (death dog puppy)Two puppy dog heads sticking out of one of the soon-to-be constructs in the second chamber.
**5:** An iron golem in the third chamber that is currently powered down, but could be tinkered to life with a successful DC 18 Intelligence check.
**6:** 2d4 seemingly active constructs that are actually just animated armor haunting this room.

### Yellow Door:
### Green Door:
### Blue door:
**Sudoku**
The door opens into a large oblong room. on the far side is a hallway leading to stairs but the path is blocked by a massive and magical portcullis. In the centre of the room is what looks like square dais. Instead of a throne or an altar. a small stack of stone tiles sits atop the dais. Next to them is a large grid with empty squares. The squares are made of granite, marble limestone, basalt, and obsidian. a pile of likewise stones stacked neatly next to the dais

every 5 minutes, some of the unused peices will begin to float, and turn themselves into a number of small lithe stone figures that the people must fight

### Purple door:

**Nonogram**
As you step into the room like many others, lights would emerge, brighter then any you have seen in your life, Neon strips of pure energy would alight as you step inside. matching pase with the front of the group, and as the rest fell in line, the beggining of the line would keep in line with the last person. the humming of electronic music would begin to play, bass boosted technocolor. sounds and notes that truly do not exist in this world would blare out on speakers.
"My lovely delinquents, welcome too my museum, too pass, you must paint, or you must fight". underneath each of your feet, a glowing pixelated icon would shine bright through the floor panels, A sword, and a paintbrush lightly floating, animated in the floor."

any who fight pass onto a vampire blood bath, any who paint must solve a nonogram
