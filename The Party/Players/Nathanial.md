What would be like late 30s to early 40s in real life.

  

* Growing up, Skas always looked up to the scholars and musicians in his area. Following in their footsteps, he learned to play as many instruments as he could and would often poke his head around town to hear the stories of those passing through. As Skas got older, he married a beautiful woman whom he truly loves, and together they had five children. Though he has always longed to travel, his journeys were limited to only a few times a year, as he always returned home to be with his family. In recent years, he has vowed to set out on a long-lasting adventure to truly learn the world he inhabits and to discover songs and stories that no one has yet uncovered.

  

* He would be a traveling scholar-type bard, traveling to learn the world through its music and culture and learning stories through music rather than books.

  

* Skas isn’t shy of social interactions, bearing a quite friendly face that is a mix between welcoming and, due to his frame, still capable of intimidating some.

  

* His wife, whom he fell in love with in his late twenties.

  

* His mentor, a woman who taught him all she had learned during his very short-lived time as an adventurer.

  

* His eldest daughter, who has always loved hearing his wondrous and wacky stories, no matter the time of day.

  

* Skas comes from the Sky Island, spending most of his life fascinated by the travelers who would occasionally visit, having a more focused hyperfixation on traveling bards and scholars, dreaming one day of being able to travel the world as a bard learning stories through music.

  

* His main goal is to learn as many stories, history, and anything through song.

  

* Skas has gotten into his fair share of brawls but doesn’t base his identity entirely on fighting.

  

* Loves his family.

  

* Skas has purple feathers across his body.

  

* Skas has been in his share of brawls but does not pursue combat as a main focus.
