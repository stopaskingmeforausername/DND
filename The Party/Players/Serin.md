___
 • Kuro, he/him

 • Age: 18

 • A black cat with weird iridescent sheen, like magpie feathers on his fur. Biiiig yellow eyes. Wears a blue and black jester outfit that is burnt at the edges. Yes, it’s got one of those big fancy ruffly collar things. Wears tassel earrings and a big bell.

 • Was a jester of a traveling circus, and kind of bad at it. Born into it and knows very little else. Burnt a lot of it down by accident and got kicked out.

 • Bad at being a jester because he cares too much. Struggles at coming up with stuff fast, and often self flagellates after every joke he tries to make anyways.

 • Knows: Hakuri, the tibbit “leader” in the circus – she/her. Big tabby kitty, strong and stern. Held no enjoyment in kicking Kuro out. Jia, the circus leader. Very angry with Kuro. Eiko, Kuro’s parent. Cares for Kuro very much, and distraught at Kuro being removed.

 • Trying to find a place to belong, again! Going to the new world because he wants a fresh start.

 • Likes fighting. Battles help expel some of his twitchy energy.

 • Hates being picked up, likes scritches. Impulsive and all over the place.
